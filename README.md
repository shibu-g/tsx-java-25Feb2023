webhook api through github useing ngrok

hi 
in this project i make 2 api 
***first one is for getting the notification from github when
in my github in the "dummy-github-events" repository . when someone make any push request
to thet repository or pull request or marge request ,then in my console in the log 
you can see all the information . 
my all code are in my localhost but by the help of ngrok we can make out localhost page
visible to the all users .

***in the second one you can fetch all the commits thet in the "dummy-github-event" 
repository has ,you can fetch all the repository through "localhost:8092!getallcommits"
but this is present on my locallly noone can access it for this i use ngrok thet generate
a link for localhost and the port for thr help of this anyone can fetch the data from api.
